## Overview

These scripts allow you to generate reports for node delegations and BEAM stakes for your validator on the Avalanche network. They are designed to run manually, print the results to the console, and save the data to JSON files (`nodes_report.json` and `stakes_report.json`).

- `generate_nodes_report.py`: Generates a report of node delegations.
- `generate_stakes_report.py`: Generates a report of BEAM stakes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`).
- Access to an Avalanche node running on `http://127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/rpc`.

## üìã How to Use the Scripts

### 1. Download the Scripts
Download `generate_nodes_report.py` and `generate_stakes_report.py` from this repository.

### 2. Configure the Scripts
To use the scripts, you need to set the `NODE_ID` with your validator's hexadecimal identifier. Follow these steps to obtain it:

#### Step 2.1: Obtain Your `validationID`
1. On your server where your Avalanche node is running, execute the following command in the terminal, replacing `INSERT_YOUR_NODE_ID_HERE` with your `nodeID` (e.g., `NodeID-GvYGeH3hZrX751Ppzzaee5YiqM1EcJhxT`):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "validators.getCurrentValidators", "params": {"nodeIDs": ["INSERT_YOUR_NODE_ID_HERE"]}, "id": 1}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/2tmrrBo1Lgt1mzzvPSFt73kkQKFas5d1AP88tv9cicwoFp8BSn/validators
   ```
2. In the response, look for the `validationID` value. For example:
   ```json
   "validationID": "fMyGzmMYsfnyHh7VNUXk8yNk9JtanU3KrKdeaPsJwm3UYEeme"
   ```
   Copy this value.

#### Step 2.2: Convert the `validationID` to Hexadecimal
1. On your local machine (e.g., your personal computer), create a file named `decode_validation_id.py` with the following code:
   ```python
   import base58

   # Instructions: Replace the value of validation_id with the validationID you obtained from the curl command
   validation_id = "INSERT_YOUR_VALIDATION_ID_HERE"

   # Decode Base58 to bytes
   decoded = base58.b58decode(validation_id)

   # Extract the payload (the 32 bytes after the prefix and before the checksum)
   payload = decoded[12:-4].hex()

   # Print the hexadecimal value to use in the scripts
   print(f"Hex value to use in the scripts: 0x{payload}")
   ```
2. Install the `base58` library on your local machine (this does not affect your server):
   ```bash
   pip install base58
   ```
3. Open the `decode_validation_id.py` file and replace `INSERT_YOUR_VALIDATION_ID_HERE` with the `validationID` you obtained (e.g., `fMyGzmMYsfnyHh7VNUXk8yNk9JtanU3KrKdeaPsJwm3UYEeme`).
4. Run the script on your local machine:
   ```bash
   python3 decode_validation_id.py
   ```
   The output will be the hexadecimal value to use in the scripts. For example:
   ```
   Hex value to use in the scripts: 0x571ac781c64ab162b8c2c22ba49cb3dbe62e7be62d1e78f274346bd3a7dbb856
   ```

#### Step 2.3: Set the `NODE_ID` in the Scripts
1. Open the scripts `generate_nodes_report.py` and `generate_stakes_report.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the line:
   ```python
   NODE_ID = "INSERT_PUBLIC_NODE_IDENTIFIER_HERE"
   ```
3. Replace it with the hexadecimal value you obtained, for example:
   ```python
   NODE_ID = "0x571ac781c64ab162b8c2c22ba49cb3dbe62e7be62d1e78f274346bd3a7dbb856"
   ```
4. (Optional) In `generate_stakes_report.py`, set `VALIDATOR_STAKE` to the amount of BEAM staked by your validator. If left as 0, the total BEAM will only include delegated stakes.

### 3. Run the Scripts
- Run the node delegations report:
  ```bash
  python3 generate_nodes_report.py
  ```
- Run the BEAM stakes report:
  ```bash
  python3 generate_stakes_report.py
  ```

### 4. View the Results
- The scripts will print the results to the console.
- Two JSON files will be generated: `nodes_report.json` (node delegations) and `stakes_report.json` (BEAM stakes).

### 5. Share the Reports
- Share the generated JSON files with your community by uploading them to a file-sharing service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) and sharing the links.

## Notes
- The scripts hide wallet addresses and transaction hashes for privacy (showing only the first 6 and last 4 characters).
- The scripts run once and terminate, making them suitable for manual execution.
- Ensure your Avalanche node is running and accessible at the specified URL.
- This process does not require your validator server to be public or to install anything on it.
- If you have trouble running the Python script, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your local machine (`python3 --version`) and that you have installed the `base58` library.
